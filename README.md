**BRUCE SIMIYU**

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Brucedevnairobi, I am a hobbyist web developer with a softspot for the frontend.
With most businesses and interpersonal relations turning towards the online environment, websites are becoming the new home.
I am on creating functional and optimized web solutions to foster these relations.
I am able to achieve this through continous cultivation of knowledge in the frontend tech stacks as well as UX design.

Here are some of the projects I have worked on.
